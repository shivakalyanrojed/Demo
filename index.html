        <h2>About Cars</h2>
        <div>
            <p>A <strong>car</strong> or <strong>automobile </strong> is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on<br> roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people (rather than goods).</p>
            <p>Cars were invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz <em>Patent-Motorwagen.</em><br> Cars became widely available during the <strong>20th century.</strong> One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the<br> <strong>1908</strong> Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.</p>

            <p>In the early days of the <em>automobile</em>, there were just a handful of companies that were itching to grow. Today, however,<br> there are <strong>14</strong> major global corporations that control more than <strong>60</strong> major automotive brands across the globe, and that doesn't<br> even count the smaller local companies in various countries around the world.</p>

                    <p>A hatchback is a car type with a rear door that opens upwards. They typically feature a four-door<br>configuration, excluding the rear door. However, two-door hatchbacks are not uncommon.</p>
                    <p>Examples of four-door hatchbacks: Maruti Suzuki Alto 800, Renault Kwid, Hyundai Grand i10, etc.</p>

                    <p>Out of the different types of cars, a sedan (US) or a saloon (UK) is traditionally defined as a car with four<br> doors and a typical boot/ trunk. A slightly technical detail is that it usually features a 3-box configuration<br> with each of the boxes categorically used for the engine, passenger, and cargo</p>
                    <p>Examples of sedans: Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, Hyundai Elantra, etc.</p>

                    <p>Conventionally, a sports utility vehicle (SUV) is a big car built on a body-on-frame chassis, sports increased<br> ground clearance and offers off-roading capabilities to a certain extent. With that said, the <br>aforementioned definition of an SUV has blurred over time and often includes both off-roaders and soft-roaders.</p>
                    <p>Examples of off-roader SUVs: Mahindra Thar, Mahindra Scorpio, Land Rover Discovery Sport, etc.</p>

                    <p>A simple, and common, definition of a crossover would be that it is a vehicle that combines the features of <br>an SUV and a hatchback. Crossover vehicles offer soft-roading capabilities and are constructed like a car -<br> they use unibody construction instead of the body-on-frame platform used in SUVs.</p>
                    <p>Examples of crossovers: Maruti Suzuki S-Cross, Volvo S60 Cross Country, Hyundai i20 Active, etc.</p>

                        <p>A convertible, a.k.a. a cabriolet or roadster, is a car with a roof structure that can be 'converted' to allow<br> open-air or enclosed driving. They feature either a retractable hardtop roof or soft folding top.</p>
                        <p>Examples of convertibles: Mercedes-AMG SLC 43, Audi A3 Cabriolet, Ferrari California T, etc.</p>
